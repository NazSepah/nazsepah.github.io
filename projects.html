<p>
My interest lies at the intersection of Deep Learning and Graphical Modeling. Particularly, I am interested in Bayesian Deep Learning methods and their application in real world problems. The application I am working on during my PhD is healthcare. More specifically, I am working on developing a framework from temporal imaging data to probabilistically predict the future of disease in patients suffering from Multiple Sclerosis. There main aspects of my PhD project are as follows.
<p>
<p>
The primary focus of my PhD work is to develop a model using Probibilistic Deep Learning methods that is capable of predicitng disease prognosis in MS patients. although there are multiple approaches one can take to tackle this problem, probabilistic deep learning seems to be an ideal framework for two main reasons: 1. prediction of future in any real world problem deterministically can be very risky and the risk is much higher for healthcare applications as patients lives are at stake. 2. MS is known to be a heterogeneous disease that manifest and develop differently from one patients to another.

<p>
Another focus on my work is In addition, due to the scarcity of data in my field which could potentially impact the performance of the model significantly, I am constantly looking for unsupervised methods that can be incorporated in my model. At the moment I am looking into how I can include methods from knowledge distilation and domain adaption in my work.
