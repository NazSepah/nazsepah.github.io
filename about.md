<p>
I am a PhD student in the <a href="http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~pvg/">Probabilistic Vision Group</a>, at the Centre for Intelligent Machines(CIM), McGill/Mila where I work under the supervision of Dr. Tal Arbel. I am also lucky enough to be working closely with Dr. Doina Precup (Machine Learning Professor at Mila), Dr. Tal Hassner (Senoir Computer Vision Scientist at Facebook) and Dr. Douglas Arnold (Neurologist at McGill). Together, we are working on developing a Bayesian Deep Learning framework for predicting the future of disease in patients with MS from temporal imaging data.

Prior to joining McGill I obtained my masters degree in Cognitive Neuroscience for University of Waterloo and my undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering from University of Tehran.
